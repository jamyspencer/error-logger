Simple error logging program - not very useful in current form.

It will save two humorous errors to a linked list, then save them to a file -
logfile.txt by default, though this can be changed with the -l flag.

If somehow two errors didn't get logged, an error code (including a errno value)
will be displayed but not logged to the file. I thought of running the savelog
function recursively in this case but didn't want the possibility of infinite loops.

---Options---
-h Displays simple help menu
-n Changes "nValue"
-l Changes the file name that the error log is saved to.
